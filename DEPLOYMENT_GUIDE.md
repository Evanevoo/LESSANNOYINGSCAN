## ðŸ”§ **STEP 1: DATABASE SETUP**

### **1.1 Apply the Delivery Schema**
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of delivery_schema_fixed.sql
-- This creates all the necessary tables for delivery management and notifications
```

**Tables Created:**
- `deliveries` - Main delivery management
- `delivery_items` - Items being delivered
- `delivery_zones` - Geographic delivery zones
- `delivery_routes` - Route optimization data
- `driver_locations` - Real-time driver tracking
- `notifications` - In-app notification system
- `notification_preferences` - User notification settings

### **1.2 Verify Tables Created**
Check that all tables were created successfully in your Supabase dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ **STEP 2: NETLIFY FUNCTIONS SETUP**

### **2.1 Install Dependencies**
Add these to your `package.json` dependencies:

```json
{
  "nodemailer": "^6.9.7",
  "twilio": "^4.19.0"
}
```

### **2.2 Configure Environment Variables**
Add these to your Netlify environment variables:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail example)

```

### **2.3 Deploy Netlify Functions**
The following functions are already created:
- `netlify/functions/send-email.js`

Deploy them to Netlify by pushing your code.

## ðŸ”§ **STEP 6: CONFIGURATION**

### **6.1 Email Service Setup**
**For Gmail:**
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an app password
3. Use the app password in EMAIL_PASSWORD

```

### **7.3 Database Migration**
Ensure all database changes are applied to production:
1. Run the delivery schema
2. Verify all tables exist
3. Test RLS policies

---

## ðŸ”§ **STEP 8: MONITORING**

### **8.1 Check Logs**
Monitor your Netlify function logs for:
- Email sending errors

## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**

**1. "organization_id does not exist" error**

- Check database permissions

**5. Mobile app location issues**
- Ensure location permissions are granted
- Check Expo location configuration
- Verify device GPS is enabled
