### 4. **Location Management (Locations.jsx)**
- **Tax Rate Configuration**: Manage GST and PST rates per location
- **Province-based Settings**: Different tax rates for Saskatchewan and British Columbia
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic total tax rate calculation
- **Database Integration**: Proper Supabase integration with error handling
- **Summary Cards**: Overview of locations and tax rates

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure
