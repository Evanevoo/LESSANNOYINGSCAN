- **Customer Access**: Restored from latest backup

### Recovery Process
1. **Immediate Response** (0-30 minutes)
   - Activate disaster recovery team
   - Isolate compromised systems
   - Assess damage scope

2. **System Recovery** (30 minutes - 2 hours)
   - Deploy clean infrastructure
   - Restore from latest backup
   - Verify data integrity

3. **Service Restoration** (2-4 hours)
   - Test all functionality
   - Restore customer access
   - Resume normal operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Using the Disaster Recovery Dashboard

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Log in as system administrator
2. Navigate to Owner Portal
3. Click "Disaster Recovery"

### Creating Emergency Backups
```javascript
// Manual backup creation
const backup = await createEmergencyBackup();

// Backup includes:
// - All critical data tables
// - Metadata and timestamps
// - Integrity verification
// - Multiple storage locations
```

### Monitoring System Health
- **Real-time Status**: Database, storage, and backup health
- **Alerts**: Automatic notifications for issues
- **Metrics**: Backup frequency, success rates, storage usage

### Restoring from Backups
1. **Select Backup**: Choose from available backups
2. **Dry Run**: Test restore without affecting data
3. **Full Restore**: Restore all data (destructive)
4. **Selective Restore**: Restore specific tables only

## üöÄ Recovery Procedures

### Complete System Recovery (Worst Case)

#### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup (0-30 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy new Supabase instance
# Configure domain and SSL
# Set up basic security
```

#### Step 2: Database Restoration (30-60 minutes)
```sql
-- Restore database schema
\i database_schema.sql

-- Restore critical data
\i critical_data_backup.sql

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bottles;
```

#### Step 3: Application Deployment (60-90 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy application code
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy

# Configure environment variables
# Test all functionality
```

#### Step 4: Verification and Testing (90-120 minutes)
- User authentication testing
- Data integrity verification
- Feature functionality testing
- Performance validation

### Partial Recovery (Specific Data Loss)

#### Single Table Recovery
```javascript
// Restore specific table
await restoreFromBackup(backupId, {
  tables: ['customers'],
  clearExisting: true
});
```

#### Point-in-Time Recovery
```javascript
// Restore to specific timestamp
await restoreFromBackup(backupId, {
  timestamp: '2024-01-15T14:30:00Z',
  tables: 'all'
});
```

## üìã Recovery Testing

### Monthly Testing Schedule
- **Week 1**: Backup verification
- **Week 2**: Partial restore testing
- **Week 3**: Full system recovery drill
- **Week 4**: Performance and security testing

### Testing Procedures
```javascript
// Automated backup testing
const testResult = await testBackupIntegrity(backupId);

// Recovery simulation
const simulation = await simulateRecovery({
  scenario: 'complete_data_loss',
  dryRun: true
});
```
