# Ticket Reopen Feature

## Overview
The support ticket system now includes the ability to reopen closed tickets, allowing for better ticket lifecycle management.

## Features Added

### For Owners (Owner Portal - `/owner-portal/support`)
1. **Reopen Button in Ticket Details Dialog**
   - When viewing a closed ticket, owners see a "Reopen Ticket" button
   - Clicking this button changes the ticket status from 'closed' to 'open'
   - The button is only visible for closed tickets

2. **Reopen Button in Actions Column**
   - In the tickets table, closed tickets show a restore icon (ðŸ”„) in the actions column
   - Clicking this icon immediately reopens the ticket
   - Provides quick access without opening the full ticket details

3. **Status Updates**
   - Reopened tickets are immediately reflected in the UI
   - Status chips update from "Closed" (green) to "Open" (red)
   - Ticket counts in the stats cards update automatically

### For Users (Support Center - `/support`)
1. **Reopen Button in Ticket Details Dialog**
   - Users can reopen their own closed tickets
   - "Reopen" button appears in the ticket details dialog for closed tickets
   - Button includes a restore icon for clear visual indication

2. **Reopen Button in Ticket Cards**
   - In the card-based ticket list, closed tickets show a "Reopen" button
   - Provides quick access to reopen tickets without opening details
   - Button is styled consistently with other actions

## How It Works

### Database Changes
- No new database tables required
- Uses existing `support_tickets` table
- Updates the `status` field from 'closed' to 'open'
- Updates the `updated_at` timestamp

### User Experience
1. **Owner Workflow:**
   - Navigate to `/owner-portal/support`
   - Find a closed ticket
   - Click "View Details" or the restore icon
   - Click "Reopen Ticket" or "Reopen" button
   - Ticket status changes to "Open"
   - Can now reply to the ticket

2. **User Workflow:**
   - Navigate to `/support`
   - Find a closed ticket
   - Click "View Details" or "Reopen" button
   - Ticket reopens and can be replied to

### Technical Implementation
- `handleReopenTicket()` function updates ticket status in Supabase
- UI immediately reflects changes
- Success/error notifications provided
- Loading states handled during the operation

## Benefits
1. **Better Customer Service:** Allows reopening tickets when issues resurface
2. **Flexible Workflow:** Supports real-world scenarios where tickets need to be reopened
3. **User Control:** Both owners and users can reopen tickets as needed
4. **Clear Visual Feedback:** Status changes are immediately visible
5. **Consistent UI:** Reopen functionality follows the same patterns as other actions

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Customer Follow-up
- Customer submits a ticket about a billing issue
- Support resolves it and closes the ticket
- Customer discovers the issue persists
- Customer can reopen the ticket instead of creating a new one

### Scenario 2: Owner Follow-up
- Owner closes a ticket thinking it's resolved
- Later discovers additional information is needed
- Owner can reopen the ticket to continue the conversation

### Scenario 3: Related Issues
- A ticket is closed after resolving the initial issue
- A related problem is discovered
- The original ticket can be reopened to maintain context

## Future Enhancements
- Audit trail for reopen actions
- Automatic notifications when tickets are reopened
- Reopen reason/comment field
- Bulk reopen functionality for owners
